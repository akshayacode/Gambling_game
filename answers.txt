1. How is gas Usage Calculated?

Gas is the Unit of computation
It is the fee paid to miners for providering computational power.

Gas Limit-> set by us
Block gas Limit -> Set by Network 
Gas Price -> Ether/gas

Gas Fee = Gas Limit * Gas Price/Unit (in Gwei)

If the contract runs out of gas, the transaction will fail, all changes to the 
state variables will be undone but still want to pay for the gas spent

2.Differnce between Memory, storage and stack.

Storage
 - Holds data between function calls.
 - Permanent storage
 - Expensive to use ( Consumes more gas)
 - State variables are in storage

Memory
 - Temporary place to store data during execution
 - If the execution stops the memory is  erased for the next execution.
 - Cheaper to use (Consumes less gas )
 - Function arguments are always in memory
 
Stack
- Temporary storage that ethereum EVM uses to bring data from other storage to work on them
- holds small variables(limitted amount of values)
- Almost Free to use
- Local variables apart from struct, mappings and arrays are stored in stack

3.Modifiers

Modifiers are used to check a condition prior to executing a function.

If the function does not meet the requirement specified in the modifier, an exeception is thrown and the function execution stops.

Modifiers are declared as:

modifier onlyAdmin(){

     require(msg.sendern == admin, " Only Admin can execute this function");
     _;// this symbol is called as merge wildcard
}


Merge Wildcard -> The body of the function is inserted where that symbol is placed in the modifiers's definition


4. Interfaces 

Interfaces allows us to interact with another contract
It does not have any state variables, contructors or any functions with implementation.
They contain only the function declarations.
function type will only be external.
The difference between an interface and a regular contract is that each function ends with ; instead of { }

Example:

// SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
pragma solidity ^0.8.0;

contract Counter {
    uint public count;

    function increment() external {
        count += 1;
    }
}

interface ICounter {
    function count() external view returns (uint);

    function increment() external;
}

contract MyContract {
    function incrementCounter(address _counter) external {
        ICounter(_counter).increment();
    }

    function getCount(address _counter) external view returns (uint) {
        return ICounter(_counter).count();
    }
}

5. Proxy Contract

A proxy contracts are used when you want to upgrade your contracts. 
The proxy contract stays immutable, but you can deploy a new contract behind the proxy contract 
- it changes the target address inside the proxy contract.
